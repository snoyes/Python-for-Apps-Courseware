Let's make a text library that can tell us interesting things about
articles, essays, novels, and other bodies of texts. For reference,
you can refer to the "Automated Testing and TDD" chapter in
PythonForLargeApps.pdf, and also the official unittest documentation:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

Now, in your labs folder, you have a file named "testing/textlib.py":

----
class BodyOfText:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text
    def num_paragraphs(self):
        return -1
    def paragraphs(self):
        return []
----

Your labs folder also has a file named "testing/test_textlib.py" containing this:

----
import unittest
from textlib import BodyOfText

class TestBodyOfText(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_story(self):
        pass
----

Run the test using the following:

----
python3 -m unittest test_textlib.py
----

When you do this, you should see the following output:

----
.
--------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
----

When you have this, go on to the next step.


# STEP 2

Let's make our code count paragraphs. We'll define the boundary
between two paragraphs as a blank line - in other words, two newlines
in a row. (Peek in "testing/story.txt" for an example.)

In "test_textlib.py", modify the "TestBodyOfText" class to do the following:

 * In "test_empty_story", create a BodyOfText instance with an empty
   string, and assert that its "num_paragraphs" method returns zero.

 * Add a method named "test_single_paragraph". Within it, create a
   BodyOfText instance for a single paragraph (i.e., a string with no
   blank lines, as described above). A single sentence will do fine.
   Assert that ".num_paragraphs()" returns 1.

* Create a test string with at least three paragraphs (see example
  below). Add a function named "test_several_paragraphs", which
  creates a "BodyOfText" instance using that test string, then asserts
  that ".num_paragraphs()" returns the correct number.

Very important: You are NOT modifying "textlib.py" yet. Only
"test_textlib.py".

For your test with several paragraphs, remember the boundary between
paragraphs is a blank line. So you might do something like:

----
# Remember, in Python, a pair of triple quotes demarcates
# a multi-line string.
three_paragraph_story = """This is a rather short story. It has three paragraphs.

Once upon a time, a brave princess went on a dangerous journey. She
had many adventures, and recruited other heros to her important and
noble cause.

She prevailed, saving the day, and made it home. Yay!"""
----

(Alternatively, you can have your test code read in the content of
"story.txt".)

Run the test (using "python3 -m unittest test_textlib.py"). You should
see something similar to the following:

----
% python3 -m unittest test_textlib.py
FFF
================================================================
FAIL: test_empty_story (test_textlib.TestBodyOfText)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "labs/testing/test_textlib.py", line 7, in test_empty_story
    self.assertEqual(0, body.num_paragraphs())
AssertionError: 0 != -1

----------------------------------------------------------------

  File "labs/testing/test_textlib.py", line 16, in test_several_paragarphs
    self.assertEqual(7, body.num_paragraphs())

================================================================

  File "labs/testing/test_textlib.py", line 11, in test_single_paragraph
    self.assertEqual(1, body.num_paragraphs())

----------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.001s

FAILED (failures=3)
----

Yours may be a different in a couple of ways. Some line numbers may be
different, and the lines starting with "assert" may look
different too. But everything else should be the same, or close to it.

Looking at your output, note that:

 * You are shown the test module and test class.
 * For each failing test, you are shown the test methods, and the line number.
 * You are shown the expected and actual values, and how they differ.
 * You wrote three different test functions, and are shown three different failures.

Identify all these elements in your output:

 * Where is the test module (test_textlib) specified?
 * Where is the test class ("TestBodyOfText") specified?
 * Where are the test methods (e.g., "test_empty_story") specified?
 * Where are the line numbers of the failing tests?

Once you have done all of this, proceed to the next step.


# STEP 3

Now it's finally time to write actual application code! Modify
"textlib.py" to make the tests pass. Run them again with "python3 -m unittest
test_textlib.py". You'll know when they pass by the following output:

----
% python3 -m unittest test_textlib.py
...
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.000s

OK
----

Congratulations. You just did test-driven development!


# EXTRA CREDIT

Using test-driven development, add a method to "BodyOfText" called
"paragraphs", which returns a list of strings: the paragraphs in the
text body. The steps should go something like this:

 * Add a stub method called "paragraphs" to "BodyOfText", which
   returns an empty list.
 * Add assertions to "test_empty_story", "test_single_paragraph", and
   "test_several_paragraphs" that check for a correct return value
   when this method is called.
 * Run the test and observe that it fails like it should. This is the
   first checkpoint, so to speak.
 * Change "BodyOfText.paragraphs" so the tests now
   pass. This will be the next checkpoint.
 * Look at your code for the "num_paragraphs" and "paragraphs"
   methods. Is there some way you can simplify your code? If so,
   refactor - notice how you can use the tests to verify you didn't
   introduce any new bugs!
