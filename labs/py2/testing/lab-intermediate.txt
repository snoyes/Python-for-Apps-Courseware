Suppose you decide, because of some new requirements for "textlib",
that "BodyOfText" must now reject an empty string as input. You want
to ensure its constructor throws "ValueError" if invoked this way.


# STEP 1

In "test_textlib.py", modify "TestBodyOfText.test_empty_story()" to
assert that "ValueError" is raised if "BodyOfText" is invoked with an
empty string argument.

Run the test, and see the test failures. When you do, go to the next step.


# STEP 2

Modify "textlib.py" so all tests pass.


# STEP 3

Let's extend "textlib" to add a class representing paragraphs. In the
process, you'll gain insight in how valuable test-driven development
is when refactoring.

Add the following class stub to the top of "textlib.py":

[source,python]
----
class Paragraph:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text
    def num_sentences(self):
        return -1
----

Notice that, just like "BodyOfText", this "Paragraph" class is a
stub. For now, this is the ONLY change you're going to
make to "textlib.py".

Next, modify "test_textlib.py" in the following ways:

 * Import your new "Paragraph" class.
 * Create a new subclass of "unittest.TestCase", called "TestParagraph".
 * In "TestParagraph", add a method "test_empty_paragraph" to
   assert that "ValueError" is raised if "Paragraph" is invoked with an
   empty string argument.

* Create methods "test_single_sentence()" and "test_several_sentences()"
  that check on a paragraph containing one sentence, and (at least)
  three sentences, respectively.

Run your tests, observing a meaningful failure for each of the new
test functions. The key here is _meaningful_, meaning the failure
indicates your application code is not (yet) working, as opposed to
the test code itself not yet working. Suppose you saw the following:

----
ERROR: test_single_sentence (test_textlib.TestParagraph)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "labs/testing/test_textlib.py", line 20, in test_single_sentence
    para = Paragraph("Hello there.")
NameError: name 'Paragraph' is not defined
----

This is a bug in the test code, because it doesn't import "Paragraph"
properly. In contrast, a meaningful failure looks more like this:

----
FAIL: test_single_sentence (test_textlib.TestParagraph)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "labs/testing/test_textlib.py", line 21, in test_single_sentence
    self.assertEqual(1, para.num_sentences())
AssertionError: 1 != 0
----

Once you have the tests written correctly, your output will
include several failed-assertion blocks - for example:

----
================================================================
FAIL: test_several_sentences (test_textlib.TestParagraph)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "labs/testing/test_textlib.py", line 35, in test_several_sentences
    self.assertEqual(5, para.num_sentences())
AssertionError: 5 != -1
----


# STEP 4

Make the tests pass for your expanded "test_textlib.py", by
implementing "Paragraph.num_paragraphs()" in "textlib.py".

Congratulations. You're done!


# EXTRA CREDIT

(NOTE: If you are using Python 3, I recommend you pause here, and go
to "lab-subtests.txt", so you can get practice with subtests. Once
you've completed that, you can come to this lab and continue. If you
are using Python 2, just keep going in this lab.)

1) Think of some other possible invalid inputs to "Paragraph" or
"BodyOfText": a string consisting of just whitespace, a multi-line
string with no words, etc. Use test-driven development to ensure
"ValueError" is raised for these inputs.

2) Add some additional tests in the vein of
"TestParagraph.test_several_sentences", for the following sentences
below. For each one, follow the test-driven development cycle. Add the
new assertion, and run the test; watch it fail. Once you see that,
make it pass by implementing new logic in the "Paragraph"
class. Include the following one-sentence paragraphs:

  * "My favorite website is docs.python.org, with reddit.com a close second."
  * "I bought a basket of fruit for Mrs. Smith's birthday."
  * "I will arrive between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m."
  * "Your total is $10.43."

And the following multi-sentence paragraphs:

  * "Yay! We made it. High five!" (3 sentences)
  * "Did you tell Mr. Burke yesterday? We're bringing the birthday
    cake tomorrow." (2 sentences)
